To give credit where credit is due, the concept of the data playground as place for local experimentation with metadata is heavily inspired by other projects listed here:

* Library of Congress Labs (check this project [here](https://labs.loc.gov/)) 
* Carneguie Hall Data Lab (check this project [here](https://carnegiehall.github.io/datalab/))
